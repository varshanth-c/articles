        <h2>Historical Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The early developments in VR trace back to the 1960s, with the creation of the Sensorama by Morton Heilig in 1962. This immersive device provided a multi-sensory experience using stereoscopic 3D visuals, sound, and even aromas. In 1968, Ivan Sutherland and his student, Thomas Furness, developed the first head-mounted display (HMD) called the "Sword of Damocles," laying the groundwork for wearable VR.

        <p>
            The 1980s saw advancements with Jaron Lanier coining the term "virtual reality" and introducing the DataGlove and EyePhone. SEGA's VR-1 motion simulator in the early '90s marked a notable milestone, but VR faced setbacks due to technological limitations and high costs.

            The breakthroughs in the 2010s were transformative. Oculus Rift, introduced in 2012, rekindled interest, and its acquisition by Facebook in 2014 fueled further development. Valve and HTC collaborated on the Vive in 2016, incorporating room-scale tracking. PlayStation VR brought VR to mainstream gaming.
